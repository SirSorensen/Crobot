• Deliberative: using an internal model to plan actions.
    • Same thing many names: the symbol-based paradigm/hierarchical paradigm/deliberative
                             architectures/GOFAI architecture

• Reactive: making decisions based on immediate sensor readings, responding directly to changes in
            the environment without internal planning or prediction.
    • Behaviors in behavior-based and embodied paradigms

• Hybrid: combines both reactive and deliberative control, allowing it to quickly respond to
          immediate changes in the environment while also planning actions over the longer term to meet strategic objectives.
