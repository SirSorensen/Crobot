Even simple designs can lead to surprisingly interesting kinds of behavior

• Behavior is more than control:
    • Morphology and interactions with the environment are important.

• Behavior is emergent from interaction between robot and environment
    • Deterministic control do result in non-deterministic behavior (no precise predictions)
    • There must be a balance between body and brain complexity (small brain in simple robots)
